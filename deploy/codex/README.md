# CODEX deployment

A deployment of CODEX with all the moving parts.

## Local (via docker-compose)

The configuration is by environment variable via the `.env` file in this directory.

### development interface

For development purposes, this setup exposes each of the services as follows:

<!-- don't use port 80 when defining any hosts -->
- EDM - http://localhost:81/
- Sage (Wildbook-IA) - http://localhost:82/
- Houston - http://localhost:83/
- pgAdmin - http://localhost:8000/
- CODEX (frontend) - http://localhost:84/
- CODEX (api docs) - http://localhost:84/api/v1/
- GitLab - http://localhost:85

### Usage

#### Running the applications

Run the deployment locally with docker-compose:

    docker-compose up -d && sleep 5 && docker-compose ps

Note, the composition can take several minutes to successfully come up.
There are a number of operations setting up the services and automating the connections between them.
All re-ups should be relatively fast.

#### Cleaning up

Cleanup volumes:

    docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q | grep codex_)

Big red button:

    docker-compose down && docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q | grep codex_)

Precision nuke example:

    docker-compose stop houston && docker-compose rm -f houston && docker volume rm codex_houston-var

#### Running without gitlab

Running the gitlab service takes up lots of memory and if you are unable to run
it , it is possible to use the development local git alternative.  If you
already started gitlab and houston, you can stop them by doing:

    docker-compose rm --stop -f houston gitlab
    docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q -f dangling=true | grep gitlab-var)
    docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q -f dangling=true | grep houston-var)

Use the development docker-compose file:

    ln -s docker-compose.dev.yml docker-compose.override.yml
    docker-compose up -d

This should create the houston service again but not the gitlab one.

#### Running the tests

During development, we mount the code directory and by default run commands as
root. In Linux, this causes newly created files to be owned as root.  We can
either `chown` it or try to run as the host user.

First create the user with the host user uid and gid:

    GID=$(id -g); docker-compose exec -u root houston /bin/bash -xec "groupadd --gid $GID $USER; useradd --uid $UID --gid $GID $USER"

Start a shell within the houston container as the host user:

    docker-compose exec -u $USER houston /bin/bash

Or start a shell within the houston container as root:

    docker-compose exec houston /bin/bash

Now within the houston container you can run the tests:

    unset FLASK_CONFIG
    pytest

Note, `FLASK_CONFIG` is unset here because it conflicts with the tests.
It's something that will need fixed. This is simply a work around until then.
